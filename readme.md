This is an open-source library to push updates of your ML/DL model training to mobile.
`Here's a sample experiment <https://web.lab-ml.com/run?run_uuid=4e91a0e2f37611eabc21a705ed364f19>`_.

`You can host this on your own <https://github.com/lab-ml/app/blob/master/docs/installation.rst>`_. We also have a small `AWS instance running <https://web.lab-ml.com>`_,
and you are welcome to use it. Please consider using your own installation if you are running lots of
experiments. Thanks.
